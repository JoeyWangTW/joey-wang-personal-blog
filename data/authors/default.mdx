Hi! I'm Joey, I was born and raised in Taiwan. Currently liveing in the Seattle area.

Working as a software engineer @ [Donut](https://www.donut.ai), working on [Gatheround](https://www.gatheround.com).

I love to build things, not limited to software, I build physical stuff in my garage too.
Continuously finding ways to make the world a better place, and have fun along the way.
